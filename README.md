Alot of your SMTP and SMS services help you to send messages and most times you are barely aware of the delivery status of these messages. In most cases you dont get a delivery report or dont store or dont even track it. nkejen is here to help automate all these for you and easily configurable. nkejen is unique with the following features:

1. Configurable to be used with any SMTP credentials (SMTP Server, SMTP Username, SMTP Password)
2. Retry policy configuration for message to retry when it fails
3. Easily and simply track status of messages in the system

Open to contribution and usage

Thanks and happy messaging
